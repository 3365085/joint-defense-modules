"""T0 research-grade evidence, benchmark governance, and frontier planning tools.

These modules are intentionally lightweight and detector-agnostic.  They do not
replace the existing Model Security Gate training code; they add a stricter
research protocol around it so that guarded engineering results, guard-free
weight purification, trigger-only ASR, leakage checks, and statistical evidence
are reported separately.
